**onryldz08/onryldz08** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 
Swarm is a decentralized, peer-to-peer storage and communication network based on the Ethereum sidechain xDAI. The platform uses its native token, BZZ, to create economic incentives and to reward honest, reliable network participation. 



Swarm aims to provide a scalable and self-sustaining infrastructure for the decentralized internet economy. Once the vision is achieved, users remain sovereign owners of their data, aligning with fair-data principles. 



The team behind Swarm believes the current model of centralized data storage is fundamentally at odds with online privacy and security. Swarm was designed to address these issues and provide the base layer of a more decentralized internet. 



Nodes running Swarm's Bee client are incentivized to provide excess bandwidth and data storage to the system using the BZZ token. The permissionless network's design gives rise to various properties not found in centralized storage solutions. They include privacy and immutability. Swarm's flexible framework also enables any decentralized application to leverage the network for data storage and messaging. 



The idea for Swarm predates Ethereum and several notable members of the Ethereum Foundation contributed to its early development. The first stable version of the network, Swarm 1.0, went live in June 2021.
